## Description
Project Four was designed to be a group project culminaition of the things we learned throughout the semester. Below is the README description from that project:

Project Information: The goal of this project was to create a data analytic product incorporating skills that were learned this term. As a group, we decided to focus on extreme weather events. Our final goals were to understand the relationship between wind event devestation and a few key characteristics, create an aggregate statistic to determine the damage caused by extreme events, create a model to predict this statistic, and then create a website to display what we learned to the general public. Our final product is a data analysis website that was developed using quarto. The tabs on this site include our goals for the project, the data download and cleaning steps, visualization of key characteristics and our aggregate statistic, as well as a page with our final model and analysis. This project required the use of quarto, various R packages (including: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, stringr, and Tidymodels), as well as programming paradigms: Supervised Machine Learning and Parallel Computing.
