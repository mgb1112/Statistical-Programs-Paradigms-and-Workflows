**Defining your Brand**

I think that this article really struck me, as coming into grad school I had absolutely no idea what my brand would be. Even now, I have a better idea, but I would say my brand is mostly defined by my goals, which are always changing. In the short term, I am honestly going day to day with hopes of finishing each term, and eventually the year. The adjustment to grad school has been a lot so I'm taking it as it comes. More long term, I obviously want to pass/do well on my qualifying exam and graduate with my masters. Then, I want to get a job in industry. Right now, I'm thinking of either genomics or something related to clinical trials.
